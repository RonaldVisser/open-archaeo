This application provides a database and an interface for adding, modifying and searching for pottery shards. Adding a shard is done via a tree-like interface for providing the system with all the exact particularities of the ornaments found on the shard, so that an expert could make an idea of what that shard looks like just by looking at the data and not the image. The interface provides a way to search for shards with the same description (pot zone, pattern type, method, inlay, design, etc)
