Cherish is a tool that aids archaeologists and designers to represent historical, urban and archaeological structures and sites in 3D by means of image manipulation and sketching. Combine disparate data types such as photographs, illustrations, diagrams, text annotations, point cloud representation, etc, into a comprehensive 3D space, to make 3D sense of the data.
