An R implementation of the Fast Marching Method (FMM), first developed by Sethian (1996), with the modifications of Silva and Steele (2012, 2014). Also included is a spatial wrapper function that makes it easier to model dispersal scenarios in geospatial domains, as originally envisaged for the study and simulation of prehistoric dispersals
