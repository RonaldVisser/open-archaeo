A package to analyze data used to determine whether samples from multiple sources can be separated, to predict the sources of samples from unknown sources, and to evaluation the validity of those predictions. Sample data can include both quantitative and qualitative data. The package includes functions for creating an analysis file from multiple files and exploratory data analysis, as well as multivariate statistical methods to determine source separation, predict sources of unknown samples, and evaluate the validity of the predictions (principal components, classification trees, and random forests).
