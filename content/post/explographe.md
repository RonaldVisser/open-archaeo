Application (in LibreOffice Calc) for serializing a graphic matrix from counting tables. The application makes it possible to obtain either a serograph or a graph of the PVI matrograph type (visualization of the differences in independence from the percentages of independence values) which does not favor the vision of the variables over that of the lines and more suitable for non-chronological treatments.
