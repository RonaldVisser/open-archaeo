A list of open source archaeological software and resources

See [ToDo.md](https://github.com/zackbatist/open-archaeo/blob/master/ToDo.md) for a list of tools or resources that are in demand, but which currently do not exist or need to be significantly improved. See [tags.md](https://github.com/zackbatist/open-archaeo/blob/master/tags.md) for a description of all tags.

This readme and the [web interface](https://open-archaeo.info) are automatically generated from data stored in [open-archaeo.csv](https://github.com/zackbatist/open-archaeo/blob/master/open-archaeo.csv). Please update the csv when submitting a pull request.
