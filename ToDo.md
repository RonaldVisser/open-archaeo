# To do
This is a list of tools or resources that are in demand, but which currently do not exist or need to be significantly improved.

- [ ] Bayesian stratigraphic modelling in R
- [x] Harris matrices R package
  - This is being worked on at [stratigraphr](https://github.com/joeroe/stratigraphr)
- [x] TFQA (Tools for Quantitative Archaeology) development
  - This is being worked on at [tfqar](https://github.com/sslarch/tfqar)
- [ ] R packages for analysizng publication / professional metrics
- [ ] Software for displaying astronomical visibility at a given place and time
  - Shows astronomical relations if given a coordinate, a coordinate and an angle, or two coordinates in eyeshot
  - It should allow to get a quick estimation if a certain location or man made structure was build with respect to astronomical features as discussed in [Cultural Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_astronomy)
  - Despite the obvious problem that correlation does not mean causation, for some contexts, like for example ritual architecture in the European Metal Ages, astronomical obervations seemed to be very relevant
  - This software package should allow the user to get a quick overview about possible relations like solstices, lunistice, planet rises, etc
- [ ] R package to download data from open dendro data archives. Something like [c14bazAAR](https://github.com/ISAAKiel/c14bazAAR) but for dendro dates.

## Improvements to open-archaeo
- [x] Implement a tag-based system rather than categories, so that multiple standard descriptors can be used for each item
- [x] Nicer website
- [ ] Contributing guide
- [ ] Tag list
- [ ] Tag search
- [ ] Update author names with links to their profiles
